# Structure-of-Programming-Languages-Project
For this project I will be comparing two programs to find the n-th Fibonacci number.  The programming languages I decided to compare are C++ and Python. <br />

I coded each program in Visual Studio Code.  To run these programs locally you can either open them in Visual Stuido or copy and paste the programs into any online C++ and Python compilers. <br />
